Synopsis

During the Cold War in the 1980s, Aliens attacked a Cameroonian military base with a chemical weapon which caused a plague: This plague transformed all the soldiers present into super raging and immortal creatures. for a reason which we do not know, you are the only survivor of this attack and curiously, there are 5 capsules of antidote in the base (do not ask us who put them there) which you must recover and inject them into the infected soldiers to neutralize the effect of the plague.
